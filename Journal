We were introduced to computer science from differend angles. We got simple task we still haven't solved. Hope I will figgure it till next time.
We learned how to navigate files in cmd, I also instaled linuxvirutal maxhine
I started with programing, I made my first bash program, learnd how to store and use variable and got familiar with nano function
We learned how to make a menu, I already knew that becouse I did the homework, then we did a game with if sentances, which I also already know how to do.
Continue to do loops, we tried with logical operations but it didn't work
I figgured out how to deal with logical operator in while loops, we got introduced to for loops
We did a lot of things, to fast, my repository didn't work, so I am really confused right now, will try to figgure everything out till my next class, topic was documentation and README file
